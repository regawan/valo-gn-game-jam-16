# Valo

A game for Aalto GN! Game Jam #16. Playable at [Itch.io](https://regawan.itch.io/valo).

A survivor-like game where every shot counts. The world has been consumed by darkness, and your only source of light is the muzzle flash of your trusted rifle. But in the shadows, something lurks—watching, waiting. Just because you can’t see them… doesn’t mean they’re not there.
